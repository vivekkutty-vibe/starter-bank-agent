# Deploying Your Application

Since this is a static Vite application, you can deploy it for free using **Netlify** or **Vercel**.

## Option 1: Netlify (Easiest)

1. **Build the project**:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```
2. **Deploy via CLI**:
   - Install Netlify CLI: `npm install -g netlify-cli`
   - Deploy: `netlify deploy --prod --dir=dist`
   - Follow the prompts to create a new site.

3. **Deploy via Drag & Drop**:
   - Zip the `dist` folder generated by `npm run build`.
   - Go to [Netlify Drop](https://app.netlify.com/drop).
   - Drag and drop your zip file.

## Option 2: Vercel

1. **Install Vercel CLI**:
   ```bash
   npm install -g vercel
   ```
2. **Deploy**:
   ```bash
   vercel
   ```
   - Follow the prompts (Select "Yes" for "Link to existing project?" if it's the first time).
   - Vercel will automatically detect the Vite setup and build it for you.

## Important Note on Routing
If you use `react-router-dom` (which this app does), you need a redirect rule to handle SPA routing.

### For Netlify:
Create a file named `public/_redirects` with the following content:
```text
/*    /index.html   200
```

### For Vercel:
Create a `vercel.json` in the root directory:
```json
{
  "rewrites": [{ "source": "/(.*)", "destination": "/index.html" }]
}
```
